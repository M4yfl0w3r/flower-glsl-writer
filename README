GLSL writer
***********

    GLSL writer is a library for generating GLSL shaders at compile time.

    It is not a GLSL compiler and does not prevent you from writing 
    incorrect GLSL code. It does not check types or function parameters.
    The library provides GLSL expressions represented as strings and 
    allows you to concatenate them.

    Examples can be found in the test directory.


    TODO
    ****

        * a struct of all declared variables to return lvalues?
        * struct uniforms
        * lvalue arrays - structure class - struct + array
        * custom type registration (Light)
        * type system validation
        * a compile-time float to string converter
        * a simpler definition of a function
        * check if an expression is passable to a function
        * named template arguments
        * Param should take a variable as an argument
