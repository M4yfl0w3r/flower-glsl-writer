GLSL writer
    
    The library is not type-safe. It doesn't prevent you to write 
    uncorrect GLSL code. 


TODO

    * for loops
    * custom type registration (Light)
    * fix the spacing / semicolon issue
    * write a compile-time float to string converter
    * named template arguments 
    * Param should take a variable as an argument

FUNCTIONS

    * declaration

        vec4 name(type args...) { body }
    

    * call<args...>() 
        
        it takes a string as input and returns a string in the form 
        name(args, ...) as an output. A function doesn't hold a
        responsibility of adding a semicolon.
